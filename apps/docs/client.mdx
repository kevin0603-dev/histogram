## Get Started

### Install

Install the highstorm client:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
npm install @highstorm/client
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @highstorm/client
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @highstorm/client
```
</CodeGroup>

### Publish An Event

In order to publish an event, all you need is an api token. You can find your api token in the [dashboard](https://highstorm.app/keys).
You don't need to create the channel manually. It will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.


#### Quick Start

This requires adding an api key via the `HIGHSTORM_TOKEN=api_XXXXX` environment variable.

```typescript
import highstorm from "@highstorm/client"

await highstorm("my.channel", {
  event: "Something happened",
  content: "This is the content of the event",
  metadata:{
    foo: "bar"
  }
})

```


#### Highstorm Class

For more control, you can also use the `Highstorm` class. For example when you want to supply the api key manually, or `process.env` is not available on your platform.

```typescript
import { Highstorm } from "@highstorm/client"

const highstorm = new Highstorm({token: "api_XXXXX"})

await highstorm.ingest("my.channel", {
  event: "Something happened",
  content: "This is the content of the event",
  metadata:{
    foo: "bar"
  }
})

```
